    <h2>JAVA DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>
    is one of the oldest Java IDEs around, and is the first IDE that I
    ever used! It is robust and has many features, however, there
    are more modern variations of this software.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>
    is the Java IDE for those who are serious developers. It is feature rich and
    is arguably one of the best development environments around.</p>

    <h2>PYTHON DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">Pycharm</a>
    is the best IDE if you are looking to develop in Python.</p>

    <h2>C AND C++ DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a>
    is my go to IDE choice when it comes to programming in C and C++.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/">CodeBlocks</a>
    is a great IDE for both C and C++, and is comparable to eclipse
    in terms of form and function.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>.
    Yes. I know what you are thinking, "Didn't you list eclipse as a Java editor?
    Indeed I did, and I am listing it here as well because it is also able to develop
    in C and C++, given you install the proper version of it.</p>

    <h2>ALL HAIL TO THE KING</h2>
    <p><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>,
    While lacking many features a full fledged IDE has, is still a great lightweight
    choice for developing in any programming language! Just be sure you know what
    you're doing!</p>
